## Introduction
In this ML project we analyze the Iris flowers dataset. we want to see how well does the kNN 


Provide a more detailed explanation of your project. Discuss the problem it solves, the methods used, and any relevant background information.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the code just write:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Visualizations

Here you can include visualizations of the results from running the two decision tree methods. 

### Decision Tree Results (Brute Force)

### Decision Tree Results (Binary Entropy)
![Decision Tree Method 2 Visualization](results/decision_tree_figure2_visualization.png)

Here you can see the error percentage we got from the kNN and the decision tree methods.
